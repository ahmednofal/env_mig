# env_mig
My Development Environment migration script.

The script assumes the following are installed 
- Ubuntu 18.04 or above
- i3wm
- git
- vim
- gvim (prefereably)
- fzf
- ag
- 
The script logic is to clone repositories containing configuration files into their supposed locations in
the environment
